    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>It is the aim of the Company to provide a secure working environment for all employees and contractors.</p>
    <p>The Company policy is to protect people, assets, and operations, from risk of injury and loss or damage from criminal, hostile or malicious acts.</p>
    <p>All employees and contracts are expected to comply with the company security measures, and always within the law.</p>
    <h3>On-board Ships</h3>
    <p>Vessel Security is based on the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code). To this end, every vessel coming into full management is provided with an approved ship specific ‘Ship Security Plan’ (SSP).</p>
    <p>The procedure and provision for ‘visitors to vessels’ is clearly defined in the SSP, and is to be followed at all times in all ports.</p>
    <h3>Sea worthiness and navigational safety</h3>
    <p>The safety of personnel, the vessel, the cargo and the environment is paramount in navigation and vessel operations.</p>
    <p>Prior to departure from any port, the vessel shall, in all respects, be in seaworthy condition with the cargo correctly stowed and properly secured.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding ‘Custom of the Trade’, the Master is responsible for ensuring that the vessel maintains a safe under keel clearance (UKC) and remains afloat at all times.</p>
    <p>Every vessel is to be navigated in a safe and prudent manner at all times, and in strict compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, and any other applicable National or International rules and regulations.</p>
    <p>Departure from practice demanded by this Policy and its supporting procedures may be made for the protection of life, the protection of property, the prevention of pollution, or to permit compliance with the law.</p>
    <p>All navigational equipment including lights, compass, communications and signalling equipment is maintained fully operational. The company documents all defects and corrective actions. The company employs suitably trained staff capable of maintaining navigational equipment or has such staff available under contract.</p>
    <p>Ref: Navigan safety, Vessel operations and Safety management Manual</p>
    <h3>Cargo and Ballast Operations (LNG)</h3>
    <p>Cargo operations shall be performed safely, efficiently and with due consideration to the local environment. Operations shall be conducted in such a way that the charter conditions are complied with.</p>
    <p>Responsibility for cargo and ballast operations is included in the documented job description of a designated officer / PIC. Adequate manning levels ensure effective implementation of the cargo / ballast plan.</p>
    <p>There is documented procedure for planning cargo and ballast operations and the master approves each operation. Where applicable this includes procedures for heavy weather ballast, and the process for the Master’s approval of each cargo and ballast operation.</p>
    <p>Pre-arrival planning incorporates stability and stress checking at all stages of the proposed operation, including any limitation on the number and location of slack tanks. Stress, draft and trim are regularly monitored throughout the cargo operation. This allows comparison of actual and calculated stress, draft and trim to provide a proactive warning of any unplanned on unobserved deviations from the plan.</p>
    <p>Additional information may include all details relating to load/discharge rates, ballast operations, ullages, trim, cargo stowage and management of tank atmosphere, static precautions and clearing shore lines in accordance with applicable legislation and Industry Codes of Practice, e.g. IGC, BHC, IBC, ISGOTT. It is available at the ship-shore interface meeting and complied with ISGOTT recommendations. Communications and coordination between ship and shore are discussed.</p>
    <p>Procedures for ballast operations include comprehensive and detailed plans relating to the heavy-weather ballasting. Such plans include consideration of ballasting before the onset of severe weather. Other factors include, but are not limited to, deck access throughout such operations; supervision by an officer in communication with the bridge and deck personnel; line and valve settings; tank venting; and ullage monitoring.</p>
    <p>Procedures ensure independent monitoring of tank levels in addition to the primary gauging system. Suitable methods include, where applicable, the routine monitoring of automatic and/or manual tank ullages / soundings, independent high and high-high level-alarms.</p>
    <p>Ref: 06 Vessel operations</p>
    <h3>Mooring and winch brakes</h3>
    <p>The Company is committed to ensuring that all ships operating under its management are safely and securely moored at all times, when the vessel is alongside a berth, another ship or a structure.</p>
    <p>This commitment is made in line with current legislation, industry practices and OCIMF guidelines and recommendations.</p>
    <p>The vessel shall be safely moored in a manner to meet the requirements of the port and good seamanship, with due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions</p>
    <p>Special attention shall be given to any limitations imposed on the vessel, by the non-availability of securing points ashore and extra moorings placed to compensate for such limitations.</p>
    <p>To comply with this policy, the basic principles defined in the Company procedures are applicable to all sizes and types of ships engaged in world-wide trading.</p>
    <p>On all vessels, winch brakes are to be tested for their ‘Brake Rendering Capacity’ (BRC) on an annual basis, and records of tests maintained.</p>
    <p>Documented procedures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring mooring equipment and practices comply with statutory regulations, and/or industry best practices. Guidance ensures protection of personnel and safe operation of equipment during mooring operations.</li>
        <li>Obtaining and recording all weather, tide, and current ranges and forecasts, and where applicable, traffic movement.</li>
        <li>Awareness of mooring deployment and monitoring includes suitable supervision, competency of personnel, sufficient members in mooring teams and familiarity with any specific shore requirements relating to shore moorings, passing traffic or tidal concerns.</li>

    <h3>Preservation of product (service)</h3>
    <p>Constituent parts (products) in support of the management services include the supply of spares, stores and other supplies intended for a ship. Should any such items be received in the office, adequate care is taken to ensure identification, handling, packaging, storing and protection are in order till it reaches its intended destination. The purchasing Department is responsible for this activity.</p>
    <p>Suitable instructions on the above issues are also given to subcontractors or suppliers assigned to supply the above items. Vessels are instructed of the requirements of preservation of these items once received on board so that they are in a usable condition when required.</p>
    <p>All ship’s spares and stores are checked upon receipt and are stowed and secured in a proper manner, with any particular needs, e.g. frozen or chilled provisions, maximum stacking heights, humidity control, etc., given due consideration</p>
    <p>The Company’s products are its Management Services provided through its Shipboard and shore based staff. In this regard, the Company ensures that seafarers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are properly taken care of whilst travelling to the ship to commence their contracts.</li>

    <p>Stages and Status requiring to be monitored through the (Ship Management) service realization are clearly identified and where traceability is required these are identified and records maintained. For example, where appropriate or requested, the Company identifies, records and reports the progress of the voyage and charter at key points stages from beginning through completion and through each stage where such monitoring and measurements are required. This includes service status and traceability information such as ship’s position, estimated time of arrival, and cargo load port, discharge port etc.</p>
    <h3>Maintenance of the ship and equipment</h3>
    <p>The company’s objective is to protect and maintain the asset value of the vessels that the Principals have handed over and entrusted for Management and to ensure that the vessels operate to the safe optimum limits with least amount of delays and within the broad parameters of the approved budgets.</p>
    <p>The Company in this regard has established and maintains documented procedures to ensure that the ship is maintained in conformity with the provisions of the relevant rules and regulations and with any additional requirements, which may be established by the Company as well as ensuring that the overall condition of the vessel and machinery is maintained so as not to hamper the operational abilities of the vessel</p>
    <p>Ref: Technical operations manual – ER maintenance</p>
    <p>Maintenance planning takes account of the vessel’s anticipated running hours, trading area and available manpower, time frames for completion of the maintenance and cost considerations.</p>
    <p>In support of the above, the company policy is to maintain an optimum spare parts inventory or system redundancy for all ships.</p>
    <p>In meeting the above requirements, the Company ensures that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspections are held at appropriate intervals</li>
        <li>Any non-conformity is reported, with its possible cause, if known</li>
        <li>Appropriate corrective action is taken</li>
        <li>Records of these activities are maintained</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Planned maintenance systems (PMS)</h4>
    <p>Each vessel in the fleet is covered by a planned maintenance and defect reporting system. The system, which generally will be computer-based, covers all on-board equipment including all navigation, deck, engine, cargo handling and electronic equipment and machinery.</p>
    <p>The list of Equipment in PMS includes those in vessels Class survey item list (as these are surveyable)</p>
    <p>Adequate resources are provided in support of all maintenance activities. Supporting records for all maintenance activities are to be maintained as far as practicable, including those for vibration, infrared or performance monitoring of main and auxiliary equipment if carried out.</p>
    <p>The maintenance and defect reporting system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitors the vessel’s spare inventory and highlights any shortages. Those spares related to critical equipment (including environmentally critical) are given special attention</li>
        <li>Tracks all fleet-wide outstanding maintenance and defect items</li>
        <li>Alerts the staff responsible for fleet maintenance on board and ashore when it becomes due</li>
        <li>Tracks all outstanding repair items, including dry-dock work lists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The PMS covers all mooring equipment and includes routine condition monitoring, description and method for each maintenance task, the spares inventory and the replenishment of used parts.</p>
    <p>The (Fleet) Management in support of the above</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly reviews the vessel and fleet maintenance activity system.</li>
        <li>Monitors Conditions of Class (COC) or equivalent and ensures that they are closed as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Monitors accuracy of all ship certificates</li>
        <li>Ensure follow up on all required maintenance and visit ships to check the maintenance and defect correction plans and confirm company’s standards are maintained.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ref: Technical operations manual - PMS</p>
    <h4>Critical equipment and technical systems</h4>
    <p>The Company has established and maintains documented procedures to identify equipment and technical systems the sudden operational failure of which may result in hazardous situations. Planned maintenance procedures include specific measures aimed at promoting the reliability of such equipment or systems.</p>
    <p>Ref: Technical operations manual – Maintenance of critical equipment</p>
    <p>Fleet management - Critical equipment management</p>
    <p>Critical Equipment Risk Analysis</p>
    <p>These measures include the regular testing of stand-by arrangements and equipment or technical systems that are not in continuous use.</p>
    <p>The company has defined clear reporting requirements when critical systems, alarms or equipment become defective, or require planned or unplanned maintenance.</p>
    <p>Maintenance on critical equipment and systems are treated as priority in the PMS.</p>
    <p>On Tankers, a risk assessment is to be carried out requiring approvals at appropriate levels of management before such equipment is shut down.</p>
    <p>The risk assessment includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personnel, spares and tools</li>
        <li>Worst case scenarios</li>
        <li>Recovery and mitigation measures</li>
        <li>Commissioning and testing procedures</li>
        <li>Alternative back-up equipment/systems</li>
        <li>Necessary modification in operational procedures as a result</li>
        <li>Additional safety procedures (emergency).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In such cases if the agreed shut down period for critical equipment or systems is to be exceeded, any extension or relevant actions will require review by shore management. A further risk assessment is undertaken if circumstances (such as environmental conditions, crew fatigue or operational parameters) change.</p>
    <h4>Dry-docking and afloat repairs</h4>
    <p>A formal shipyard repair list is maintained ashore. The list includes all items considered unsuitable for in-service repairs. The list may be automatically generated by an on-board maintenance and defect reporting system.</p>
    <p>A considerable amount of planning is required prior to the vessel entering the Dry Dock if maintenance activities are to be completed efficiently.</p>
    <p>Ref: Technical operation manual – Dry Docking</p>
    <p>Afloat repairs similarly are to be planned before hand and all precautions required are must be agreed upon and clearly understood.</p>
    <h3>Emergency preparedness and response</h3>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <p>The Company realises that support to vessels is vital during periods of shipboard contingencies and this must be coupled with global readiness to respond all times quickly.</p>
    <p>The management system, in support of the above provides for measures ensuring that the Company’s shore-based and shipboard organisations can respond at any time to hazards, accidents and emergency situations, especially those involving their ships in an effective prompt and coordinated manner.</p>
    <p>The Company has thus established, implemented and maintains documented procedures, both shipboard and shore-based, to identify potential emergency situations and potential accidents that can have an impact on health, safety, quality and the environment, and how it will respond to them.</p>
    <p>These include effective notification procedures and communication links for alerting the emergency-response team. The system ensures there is 24-hour cover that takes account of holidays and work-related travel arrangements.</p>
    <p>Individuals including contractors and visitors are familiarised and trained in their designated emergency response roles. Designated, authorised senior personnel receive media training to ensure accuracy and control of media releases, where applicable.</p>
    <p>Ref: Emergency response manual</p>
    <h4>Business continuity plan</h4>
    <h4>Contingency plans</h4>
    <p>The Company has detailed shore and vessel contingency plans that cover all credible emergency scenarios.</p>
    <p>Vessel and shore-based contingency plans clearly identify roles, responsibilities and record-keeping procedures. These identified roles include communications and logistics personnel.</p>
    <p>Such plans also identify alternate members for key positions who can stand in for the main members. All such personnel are adequately trained and are involved in drills/exercises described below.</p>
    <p>Periodical reviews of the plans are carried out by responsible persons ashore in consultation with the vessels crew and lessons learnt from exercises and actual incidents are incorporated into the contingency plans when they are updated. The company records lessons learnt, subsequent improvements, corrective actions and resolution.</p>
    <p>Significant improvements required may also be discussed in Management Review meetings.</p>
    <p>Ref: Emergency response manual</p>
    <h4>Drills and exercises</h4>
    <p>The company carried out Drills/exercises to ensure both shipboard and shore staff including visitors and contractors are familiar with their duties and act promptly/effectively in case they are to respond to any emergency.</p>
    <p>Such drills may be shipboard or ship-shore (called an exercise) and these are carried out in a planned manner and agreed upon through an Annual Drill plan. Unscheduled drills are also additionally sometimes carried out to gauge prompt and efficient response (where considered necessary).</p>
    <p>The frequency of such drills and exercises are determined by the number of vessels within the fleet. Situations may arise when such frequencies may have to be increased. A major ship-shore exercise is to be carried out at least annually.</p>
    <p>The scope of an exercise is consistent with the size of the fleet and its trading pattern. A matrix showing the annual exercise plan is available for comparison with the completed exercises.</p>
    <p>Incident scenarios for exercises and drills are to fully test the contingency plans. Planning ensures that scenarios are credible and realistic. The scenarios for both shipboard drills and ship-shore exercises are to have varied content and duration.</p>
    <p>A review process identifies any shortcomings and allows experience sharing. The findings are circulated as appropriate and significant findings if any are shared.</p>
    <p>Exercises:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are to provide a comprehensive test of all communication and mobilisation systems. To test this, some communication and mobilisation exercises are conducted outside normal office hours.</li>
        <li>Allow the participation of a significant number of individuals. Ship staff on leave may be used to play the role of Master during an exercise.</li>
        <li>Test the effectiveness of arrangements to call on external consultants and resources as far is possible. Communication links to external resources are checked regularly during the exercises.</li>
        <li>Are documented and analysed to identify lessons learnt.</li>
        <li>Include alternative members in the Emergency Response Team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Records are maintained of participants who have been involved in Emergency Drills and exercises.</p>
    <p>Alternative members for key positions in the emergency response team are identified and trained. Lists of staff, who can perform these duties, with their contact details is maintained.</p>
    <p>The company has in place necessary arrangements to use external resources in an emergency. Contact details for salvage, towing, media consultants and technical departments of classification societies, flag states and local authorities are readily available.</p>
    <p>External or additional resources are on occasion used to provide more realistic drills and exercises.</p>

    <h3>Hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control</h3>
    <p>The Company has established and maintains documented procedures for the identification of hazards, the assessment of risks, and the implementation of necessary control measures. These procedures take into account; (But not limited to)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Routine and non-routine activities</li>
        <li>Health and Hygiene risks where appropriate</li>
        <li>Anticipated mooring arrangement and equipment to ensure Safety of personnel</li>
        <li>Activities of all personnel having access to the workplace (including contractors and visitors)</li>
        <li>Human behavior, capabilities, work culture, rest hours and other factors</li>
        <li>Identified hazards originating outside the vessel, capable of affecting the health and safety of persons on-board as well as on-board work activities which may create hazards in the vicinity of the vessel</li>
        <li>Infrastructure, equipment and other facilities at the workplace, whether provided by the company or others</li>
        <li>All other operational hazards covering safety, environmental, security impacts</li>
        <li>Actual or proposed changes in the management system and changes in the knowledge and information about hazards</li>
        <li>Past incidents, internal or external to the organisation, including emergencies and their causes</li>
        <li>Legal and other applicable requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Company’s methodology for hazard identification and risk assessment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is by its scope, nature and timing proactive rather than reactive</li>
        <li>Provides for monitoring of physical hazards, inventorying hazardous materials and assessing human factors</li>
        <li>Requires records of all valid/current assessments to be maintained on-board</li>
        <li>Provides for the classification of risks and identification of those that are to be eliminated or controlled by measures as defined in OHS objectives and management programs</li>
        <li>Ensures all Risks mitigation measures are identified through Risk Assessment based on the hierarchy of controls and are implemented prior to commencement of work</li>
        <li>Provides input into the determination of facility requirements, identification of training needs and/or development of operational controls, and improving the operating procedures in the Management System</li>
        <li>Includes provision for assessing new or non-routine tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Company ensures that the results of these assessments and the effects of these controls ashore are considered when setting its OHS objectives. Records of all risk assessments and meetings are reviewed ashore and kept on file Where required these are modified. Relevant documents are reissued in part, or as a whole, if required, after each review</p>
    <p>The Risk-assessment processes include response elements to limit the impact of any unplanned occurrences. Contingency plans have been developed to facilitate Safe Management and recovery of such situations as described in company’s Contingency Manual</p>
    <p>The company identifies best practices for common areas of risk assessment and ensures that these are shared across the fleet.</p>
    <p>The company maintains a database of all ship-generated and shore-generated risk assessments.</p>
    <p>The Company has prescribed levels for the use of PPE appropriate to the work being undertaken and the cargoes being carried by their vessels in support of Risk control measures</p>
    <p>The system includes permits for the control of any hot work onboard the vessel, including requirements for office-management review of hot work in identified hazardous areas. Other permits, such as enclosed space entry, are also used – refer to ISGOTT (For Tankers)</p>
    <h3>Environmental aspects</h3>
    <p>Within the defined scope of the environmental management system, the Company has identified the environmental aspects of its ship and shore-based operations that it can control and those it can influence and their associated environmental impacts, considering a life cycle perspective.</p>
    <p>Determination of environmental aspects takes into account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change including planned or new developments and new or modified activities and services;</li>
        <li>Abnormal conditions and reasonably foreseeable emergency situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Company determines which environmental aspects have or can have a significant impact on the environment, by using an established criteria. The Company documents this information and keeps it up-to-date.</p>
    <p>The Company ensures that the significant environmental aspects are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining its environmental management system.</p>
    <p>All sources of marine and atmospheric pollution attributable to the company activities have been systematically identified. These sources include funnel emissions (NOx, SOx), garbage, volatile organic compounds (VOC), oil emissions, ballast water, sewage and anti-fouling paints</p>
    <p>The company has an active and formally recorded programme of waste reduction management which is undertaken throughout the fleet and on all voyages. It includes, as appropriate: recycling, compacting, and grey water management.</p>
    <p>The Company has processes in place aimed at ensuring all effluent discharges are within permitted levels or are prohibited, in accordance with MARPOL Annex I, II, IV, VI, etc., and under national/regional limitations, such as European Union (EU) and US limits</p>
    <p>Responsibility for environmental performance is assigned to an appropriate person within shore management.</p>
    <p>The responsible person communicates the significant environmental aspects among the various levels and functions of the Company, as appropriate.</p>
    <h3>Resource conservation</h3>
    <p>The Company makes its best endeavours to manage vessels and its shore establishments efficiently, in order to minimise the waste of resources.</p>
    <p>The Company recognises that personnel at sea and ashore, have a duty to be ‘conservation conscious’, and endeavours to promote the concept of the conservation of resources.</p>
    <p>The Company considers resource conservation when communicating with Owners, regarding repairs and maintenance. In this respect, where relevant, resource-efficient solutions will be proposed to Owners.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the Company commitment to resource conservation, the aspect of financial consideration and constraints imposed by Owners needs are also borne in mind.</p>
    <h3>Pollution by liquid substances</h3>

    <p>The Master must exercise due caution and good seamanship practices for the acceptance onboard of correctly marked and labelled dangerous goods, and their correct stowage.</p>
    <p>The Master must also request Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) from the shippers for dangerous cargo loaded.</p>
    <p>For non-containerised cargoes, the Master must check the IMDG Code and the MSDS recommendations for packaging suitability.</p>
    <h3>Garbage</h3>
    <p>The Company recognises the need to control waste disposal in the interest of the world’s living environment and require that it’s managed ships to comply with the requirements of MARPOL 73/78 Annex V for shipboard operations.</p>
    <p>Vessels are required to work in compliance with the Garbage Management Plan. In addition, the effects on the environment must be carefully considered, before disposing of cargo residues and other materials that are not covered by MARPOL.</p>
    <p>Incinerators, and other waste/garbage disposal and/or treatment equipment, must be maintained in full operational condition, and operated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and in compliance with applicable National and International regulations.</p>
    <p>Appropriate records are maintained.</p>
    <h3>Ballast water (including transfer of micro-organisms)</h3>
    <p>The Company recognises that the carriage and disposal of ballast water can significantly contribute to the transfer of species of aquatic organisms and water-borne pathogens, from their natural habitat.</p>
    <p>Vessels are to comply with the requirements of all mandatory schemes concerning the handling of ballast water, in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Ballast Water Management Plan.</p>
    <p>Care is taken to ensure specific local/regional requirements are additionally complied with.</p>
    <h3>Emissions to atmosphere</h3>
    <p>Recognising that emissions of exhaust gases and vapours may damage the environment, the Company uses its best endeavours to control such emissions in accordance with MARPOL Annex VI and all applicable regulations, and by promulgation of such information to employees and clients.</p>
    <p>The company maintains detailed procedures in this regard.</p>

    <h3>Engine Exhaust Emissions</h3>
    <p>The Company liaises with Owners to ensure their awareness of the need to supply fuel oils of the correct specification, including low sulphur content fuel, for the respective equipment, with a view towards minimising potentially harmful elements in the exhaust emissions and applicable regulations.</p>
    <h3>Halon and CFC</h3>
    <p>Where possible, the use of CFC recovery and recycling techniques and of Halon banks is used. All latest conventions/requirements are followed.</p>
    <h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
    <p>The Company recognises the need to comply with regulations (local or otherwise) governing noise levels, and in general, to try to reduce ambient noise levels on board ships to workable standards.</p>
    <p>The Company uses its best endeavours to comply with regulations concerning noise level limits, in the operations both on board and ashore.</p>
    <p>Vessels are monitored to ensure that the effects of noise from plant operations are minimised, coincident with safe vessel operations.</p>
    <p>Where new equipment is being fitted, the Company will plan to minimise the generation of noise, both during the installation and in future operations.</p>
    <h3>Anti-fouling paint</h3>
    <p>Recognising the public concern over possible harmful effects of TBT (Tri-Butyl-Tin) on the marine environment, the Company will work with Owners of managed vessels toward eliminating the use of TBT coatings.</p>
    <p>This will be done by initially recommending to Owners the use of non-TBT coatings for underwater hull areas.</p>
    <p>All latest conventions/requirements are followed.</p>

    <h2>Quality, health, safety and environmental objectives and targets</h2>
    <p>The Company has established, implemented and maintains documented objectives and targets at each relevant function and level within the shore-based and shipboard organisation.</p>
    <p>The main forum for this are the Management Review Meetings where objectives which are to be set are discussed and agreed. This would be apart from possible instances (due to business need) where the management sets the objectives outside the Management Review process. Targets are also set in these meetings to achieve the desired objectives within defined time frames.</p>
    <p>The objectives and targets are measurable where practicable, and consistent with the Health, Safety and Environmental policy, taking into account the Company’s commitment to safe operation and prevention of pollution in compliance with applicable legal requirements along with other requirements to which the Company subscribes. Continual improvement is kept in focus.</p>
    <p>Line Managers are responsible for converting the overall objectives into functional, or individual objectives, where they apply in the scope of their control.</p>
    <p>Top management recognises its responsibility to ensure the achievement of the objectives. It is the functional responsibility of each Head of Department, however, to ensure the regular review of the objectives within his scope of control, and document the progress. The HOD must also ensure that objectives continue to reflect the business need, that they are suitably amended if necessary, and that any additional resources necessary for their achievement are planned and provided.</p>
    <p>Responsibility for achieving these objectives and targets is identified and documented.</p>
    <p>When establishing and reviewing its management system objectives, the Company:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensures compliance with mandatory rules and regulations</li>
        <li>Ensures that applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the IMO, Flag Administrations, classification societies, and maritime industry organizations are taken into account</li>
        <li>Considers the significant environmental aspects of its operations</li>
        <li>Considers the views of interested parties – including the outputs of consultation with workers and their representatives</li>
        <li>Considers technological options</li>
        <li>Considers its financial, operational and business requirements</li>
        <li>Considers its legal and other requirements. -</li>
        <li>Considers the results of the assessment of QHSE risks and opportunities</li>
        <li>Considers the outputs of consultation with workers</li>
        <li>Ensures the integrity of the management system is maintained when changes are planned and implemented</li>
        <li>Communicates the objectives clearly to all employees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management of change</h2>
    <p>The Company has established a process for the implementation and control of planned changes that impact QHSE performance. Situations where the “Management of Change” process would be considered applicable are defined.</p>
    <p>The management of change process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensures that potential consequences of a change are identified, together with any required Risk-deduction measures</li>
        <li>Clearly defines the level of authority required for the approval of a change.</li>
        <li>Ensures changes are reviewed at the defined level of authority and, where new risks are identified, the adequacy of the risk-reduction measures, is authorised by a higher authority. The appropriate level of approval required for different categories of change is based on the level of risk involved.</li>
        <li>Ensures that changes if not carried out within the proposed time scale are reviewed and revalidated, and that temporary changes do not exceed the initial authorisation for scope or time without review and re-approval by the appropriate level of management.</li>
        <li>Ensures that the documentation supporting a change includes the reason for the change, a clear understanding of the safety and environmental implications, and the appropriate level of approval. Any change is approved by senior ships' management/responsible person and not by the person directly involved in the change. The document includes reference to appropriate safety and environmental issues.</li>
        <li>Identifies all personnel that may be affected by the change and ensures that those identified understand the extent and likely impact of any planned change.</li>
        <li>Ensures that training needs arising from changes to equipment or procedures are identified and documented. All appropriate personnel receive the required training within a specific period.</li>
        <li>Links with, and ties into the document-control system, so that important controlled documentation remains up to date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When organisational changes (changes in reporting relationships, elimination of positions, restructuring, etc.), take place, the personnel responsible for supervising or managing the function(s) undergoing change are made responsible for clear and explicit reassignment of responsibilities to appropriate personnel.</p>
    <p>There are documented staff handover procedures for both shore-based personnel and ships' crews. The scope and depth of the handover process is relevant to the responsibilities of the personnel involved.</p>

    <h2>1.12 Periodical Management Review System</h2>
    <h3>QDMS Review</h3>
    <p>The QDMS must be reviewed periodically as per the stipulated plan in PAL system.</p>
    <p>The suggestions for improvement must be reported to the shore management through the Document Change Request.</p>
    <p>The Master is responsible for collating the inputs and feedback from the ship staff and submits to the office and records it in the Periodical Review template in the PAL.</p>
    <p>Only authorized shore management staff should review and approve the changes.</p>
    <p>Any obsolete documents must be removed.</p>
